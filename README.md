PSA: Be sure to include detailed comments with all new code
and code changes. It is extremely difficult to understand 
other people's code and will save everyone time and effort
if everything is well labelled. Even little things! It will 
also help you remember what you were doing if you work over 
the course of multiple days. 

Additionally, be sure to use git pull before you start working 
so you are working with the most current edits.
