PSA: Be sure to include detailed comments with all new code
and code changes. It is extremely difficult to understand 
other people's code and will save everyone time and effort
if everything is well labelled. Even little things! It will 
also help you remember what you were doing if you work over 
the course of multiple days. 

Additionally, be sure to use git pull before you start working 
so you are working with the most current edits. 

Type below here in order to send a message you wish to be seen by all group members:

It was mentioned we might want to use other software for real-time
code updates. This is a possibility, although I am more inclined to 
stick with using GitHub, as this is a tool that is not only industry 
standard and therefore a tool that we will want to familiarize ourselves 
with over the course of our college career, but is also a place to store 
all our code samples so that future employers will be able to see we 
worked, collaboratively or not, on coding projects before. Also I feel as 
though we will hardly ever encounter a time when multiple people are 
editting the project simulatneously. If you disagree, feel free to let me 
know. 						Josiah Rojas
